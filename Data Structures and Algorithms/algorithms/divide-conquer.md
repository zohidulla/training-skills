### Divide and Conquer Algorithm

Divide and Conquer algorithm muammoni hal qilish strategiyasidir..

- **Divide:** Berilgan muammoni bir-birining ustiga chiqmaydigan kichikroq masalalarga ajrating.
- **Conquer:** Kichikroq muammolarni hal qiling
- **Combine:** Umumiy natijani topish uchun kichikroq masalalar yechimlaridan foydalaning.
