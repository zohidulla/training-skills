### Geometric Algorithms

Geometrik algoritmlar - geometriyaga oid masalalarni yechish bilan shug'ullanadigan algoritmlarning bir turi. Bu algoritmlar ko‘pburchakning maydonini hisoblash, geometrik shakllarning kesishish joyini topish, nuqtalar to‘plamining qavariq korpusini aniqlash va geometrik jismlar va ularning xossalari bilan bog‘liq ko‘plab boshqa vazifalarni hal qilishda qo‘llaniladi. Geometrik algoritmlar kompyuter grafikasi, kompyuter yordamida dizayn, robototexnika va geografik axborot tizimlari kabi turli sohalarda muhim ahamiyatga ega.
