### Sorting Algorithms

Saralash algoritmi berilgan massivni yoki elementlar roʻyxatini tartibda qayta joylashtirish uchun ishlatiladi. Saralash ko'pgina dasturlash tillarini kutubxonada amalga oshirishda taqdim etiladi.

**Basics of Sorting Algorithms:**

- Introduction to Sorting
- Applications of Sorting

**Sorting Algorithms:**

- **Comparison Based:** Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Cycle Sort, 3-way Merge Sort
- **Non Comparison Based:** Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, TimSort, Comb Sort, Pigeonhole Sort
- **Hybrid Sorting Algorithms:** IntroSort, Tim Sort

**Library Implementations:**

- qsort() in C
- sort() in C++ STL
- Arrays.sort() in Java with examples
- Collections.sort() in Java with Examples
- Sort a List in Python
- Sorting in JavaScript

**Easy Problems on Sorting:**

- Check if an array is Sorted
- Sort an array of two types
- Sort a String
- Sort Each Row of a Matrix
- Sort a Matrix
- Sort a Linked List
- Sort in Wave Form
- Sort by Frequency
- Sort from Different Machines
- Check if any two intervals overlap
- Missing elements of a range
- Sort by set bits counts
- Sort even and odd placed in different orders
- Sorting Big Integers
- Sort strings by lengths
- Merge Two Sorted Arrays
- Sort when two halves are sorted
- 2 Sum - Pair in a Sorted Array
- Intersection of two sorted arrays
- Union of two sorted arrays
- Meeting Rooms

**Medium Problems on Sorting:**

- Minimum Increments to Make Unique
- Merge Overlapping Intervals
- Minimum Platforms
- Closest Pair of Elements
- Closest Pair of Points
- Chocolate Distribution Problem
- Min and Max Amount to Buy All
- Three Way Partitioning
- Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
- Sort a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s
- Inversion count
- K-th Smallest Element
- K Smallest Elements
- 3 Sum - Find Any
- 3 Sum - Closest Triplet
- Smallest Difference Triplet from Three arrays
- Merge K Sorted Arrays
- Merge K Sorted Linked Lists
- Min Unsorted Subarray to make array sorted
- Sort a nearly sorted array
- Sort n numbers in range from 0 to n^2 – 1
- Sort an array of 1 to n
- Sort according to order defined by another
- Maximum intervals overlap
- Permutation with worst Case of Merge Sort
- Minimum swaps to make two arrays identical
- Permute two arrays such that all pair suns are greater than K
- Bucket Sort To Sort an Array with Negative Numbers
- Convert an Array to reduced form using Vector of pairs
- Check if array can be sorted with conditional swapping of adjacent
- 4 Sum - Find Any

**Hard Problems on Sorting:**

- Merge Without Extra Space
- Top K Frequent Elements
- 3 Sum - Distinct Triplets
- 4 Sum - Distinct Quadruples
- 4 Sum - All Quadruples
- 4 Sum - Closest Quadruple
- Surpasser Counts in an Array
- Count distinct occurrences as a subsequence
- Minimum consecutive number subsets
- Minimum swaps for Binary Tree to BST
- K-th smallest element after removing some integers from natural numbers
- Max frequency diff such greater freq item is also is also greater
- Min swaps to reach permuted array with at most 2 positions left swaps allowed
- Making Array Elements Same
- Sort an array after applying an equation
- Array of strings in sorted order without copying strings
