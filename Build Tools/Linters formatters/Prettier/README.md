# Prettier

**Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that helps developers write consistently styled code across different projects and teams. It works by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own set of rules, taking into account factors like maximum line length and wrapping code when necessary.**

- Consistency: Prettier enforces a consistent style across your codebase, eliminating inconsistencies that can arise from different coding styles.
- Efficiency: It automates the formatting process, saving you time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually styling your code.
- Readability: Prettier's consistent formatting can improve code readability, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.
- Cross-language support: It supports a wide range of programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and more.

**How Prettier works:**

- Parsing: Prettier parses your code, understanding its structure and meaning.
- Printing: It then reprints the code according to its own set of rules, taking into account factors like maximum line length and wrapping code when necessary.
- Formatting: The final output is a consistently formatted version of your code.
