# Vite

> Next Generation Frontend Tooling

Vite is a modern frontend build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It's known for its exceptional speed and efficiency, especially during development.

- Lightning-fast Server Start: Vite leverages native ES modules to serve your code directly to the browser during development, bypassing the need for traditional bundling. This results in significantly faster server startup times.
- Instantaneous Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Vite's HMR is incredibly fast, allowing for near-instantaneous updates to your code in the browser after changes are made. This significantly improves the development workflow.
- Optimized Production Builds: While Vite excels in development, it also produces highly optimized production builds using Rollup under the hood. This ensures that your final application is efficient and well-suited for deployment.
- Framework Agnostic: Vite can be used with various frameworks, including Vue, React, Svelte, and even vanilla JavaScript projects.
- Rich Feature Set: Vite offers a wide range of features, such as TypeScript support, JSX support, CSS preprocessors, and more, making it a versatile tool for modern web development.
