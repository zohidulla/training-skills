Laracasts Series - CSS Flexbox Simplified
The main branch contains working demos for all the examples in the course. If you want to code along with me, clone the starter branch.

Each directory contains examples shown in the corresponding episode. Directory 1 contains the examples used in Episode 1, and so on upto 12 directories.
The code in each directory in this branch is the final working code at the end of each episode.
The CSS file base.css at the root contains many general styles used across all the examples. These are not really important for the concepts covered in this course.
